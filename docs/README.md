# Introduction

Data is an important asset of an organization and metadata is the key to unlock the value from that asset. Metadata provides crucial context to turn data into information and powers not just the current limited use cases of data discovery, and governance, but also emerging use cases related to data quality, observability, and most importantly people collaboration. 

Poorly organized metadata is preventing organizations from realizing the full potential of data. Metadata is incorrect, inconsistent, stale, often missing, and fragmented in silos across various disconnected tools in proprietary formats obscuring a holistic picture of data.

OpenMetadata community wants to address these challenges with the following goals:

* Centralise and connect all data assets together as a Single Source Of Truth
* Define extensible metadata schemas and APIs as an Open Metadata Standard to foster consistent understanding and easy sharing of metadata
* Empower users with end-to-end data context by making data easy to discover, understand, and collaborate on

A centralized, standards based metadata system has several benefits:

* Brings together disconnected tools and users around a single unified view of data
* Eliminates the burden of creating redundant copies of metadata by every tool and simplifies the tool
* Enables rich insights about the data making  TODO
