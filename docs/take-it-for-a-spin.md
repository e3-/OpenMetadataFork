# Take it for a spin

We want our users to get the experience OpenMetadata with the least effort 😁. That is why we have set up a [sandbox](https://sandbox.open-metadata.org) that mimics a real production setup. We appreciate it if you take it for a spin and let us know your feedback on our [mailing list](mailto:openmetadata-user@googlegroups.com), or join our [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/openmetadata/shared_invite/zt-udl8ris3-Egq~YtJU_yJgJTtROo00dQ) and post a message in the [user](https://openmetadata.slack.com/archives/C02B38JFDDK) channel.

Here is what to expect when you are on Sandbox...

### Login using your Google credentials

### Try out few things

Don't limit yourself to just the callouts. Try other things too. We would love to get your feedback.
